/**
 * Where the buildings stand and how big they are — derived from the
 * measurement rather than placed by hand.
 *
 * The version of this map that was hand-authored looked better for about a
 * week. Then a module tripled in size and its building stayed the same height,
 * because the height was a number somebody typed. Deriving the geometry from
 * what the scanner counts means the skyline re-proportions itself as the code
 * moves, and nobody has to remember to nudge it.
 *
 * What is derived: footprint, height, and archetype. What stays authored:
 * which modules exist, what they are called, what they do, and which of them
 * a flow travels through. No measurement can answer those.
 *
 * The output is plain data. A footprint that lands somewhere ugly can be
 * overridden in the authored table without fighting this file — the merge
 * prefers whatever a human wrote.
